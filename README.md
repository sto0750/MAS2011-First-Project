# P1_1.py
This program is a clock, showing the current time at the moment.
  
  #Features
  1. Uses 3 needles to point hour, minute and second each.
  2. Refreshes every 1 second, so that the second needle moves in a discrete way.
  3. An alarm bell rings every hour

  #Weak points
  1. Depending on the system, the time might not be accurate, since there is a time for the program to be run.



# P1_2.py
This program is a mimic of a solar system, with a sun and two planets, each with its moon or moons.

  #Features
  1. At each run of the program, the position and the color of planets and moons are randomly generated.
  2. There is a spaceship wandering around (randomly)

  #Weak points
  1. Each orbits are not a perfect circle, rather an oval shape, which is not what I meant for, but it's quite cool.
  2. Want to avoid the collision of each spacial bodies.

# P1_3.py
This program is representing a robot arm, with 3 arms, 3 joints and a gripper.

  #Features
  1. Uses the keyboard to rotate each arms.

  #Weak points
  1. The gripper won't stuck with the arms if I move the first two arms.
  2. Want a motion for the gripper if possible


# P1_4.py
This program is a multi-player game that battles each other.

  #Features
  1. There are two 'beetles' when the program starts.
  2. Each player can use the arrow keys and QWER keys to move and rotate their beetles.
  3. If one touches the body of the other with the horns, the player wins.

  #Weak points
  1. It would be nice if the players can choose the color and the size of their beetles at the start of the game.
